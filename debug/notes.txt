set debuger mode:
    export FLASK_DEBUG=1

url routing:
    1. variable using:
     /x/<variable_name>
     /x/<converter(e.g. int):variable_name>

    2. rules:
     /projects/ == /projects/ or /projects, (think of projects as a folder)

     /about == /about only, trying to access /about/ leads to 404, (imagine that 'about' is a file)
    
url building:
    use 'url_for(method_name, [arguments])' to get the routing url of method:'method_name' 

HTTP methods:
    @app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])

    condition [request.method == 'post'] won't work as 'post' must be capitalized to 'POST'
